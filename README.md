# music_scripts


A small code repository to manage my local music archive.

Notable applications:
* Extract song list from HTML, compare, and update naming of music file.
* Convert flac to mp3 for usage on mobile device with smaller storage, utilizing Python multiprocessing to handle CPU-bound tasks (audio converting).
